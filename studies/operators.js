I. Operators
*    0. In JavaScript, Assignment Operators are used to "assign" values to variables,
*       the most common Assignment Operator is the "=" sign and is used as such:
*/
                    var newAssignment = "Operator, Operator";
        //the Assignment Operator initiatlizes the variable: newAssignment
    //the String "Operator, Operator" is Assigned to the variable newAssignment
/*

*/                           var test = x;		
                            // "Is Equal To"  
 /*                  +=	"Is Equal to Itself Plus"
                   -=	"Is Equal to Itself Minus"
                   *=	"Is Equal to Itself Multiplied By"
                   /=	"Is Equal to Itself Divided By"
                   %=	"Is Equal to the Remainder Of"

                         x += 1 == x + 1;

                         x -= 1 == x - 1; 
                              //-> 5
                    
                         x *= 1 == x * 1; 
                             //-> 5

                         x %= 3 == 4 % 3; 
                             //-> 1
            //Modulo Operator, assigns value to the remainder of 2 numbers

/*          
*    2. Arithmetic Operators
*
*   In Programming, Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical 
*   operations. Some common arithmetic operator are:
*
*/                      var x = 5; var y = 5;
/*    +	Addition
*/                          x + y	//-> 10
/*    -	Subtraction 
*/                          x - y	//-> 0
/*    *	Multiplication
*/                          x * y	//-> 25
/*    /	Division
*/                          x / y	//-> 1
/*    %	Modulus	Returns the remainder	
*/                          x % y	//-> 0
/*    ++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1
*/                          x++ // //-> 6
/*    --	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1
*/                          x-- //-> 4

*
*    3. Comparison Operators 
*   
*   Comparison Operators are used to compare variables or data to return a 
*   result based on Boolean values and are often used in Conditional Statements.
*   Some common Comparison operators are:
*    
*/                       var x = 2; var y = 4;

*    4. Logical operators
*
*    Logical operators are used to determine the 'truthfulness'(truthy) or "falsey"
*    between two arguments, when there are two sets of arguments they are Binary 
*    Operators.

*
*    !! 
*    Logical "Not" Operator (Bang/Double Bang)
*    Double Exclamation Points
*    "If This and That are False"
*    It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand.
*    If a condition is true, then (!!)  will make it false.

*   5. Ternary Operator - 
*   
*   Takes Three Operands (   ?  :  )
*
*   Ternary Operators are Conditional (T/F) operators that take three arguments and
*   can be used as an alternate methods to "If/Else" statements, however, both
*   values must be the same type and they cannot be statements, just expressions.

*   if the condition resolves to false.
